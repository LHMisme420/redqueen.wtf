Red Queen – Adversarial Provenance + Lethality Scoring
Red Queen – Adversarial Provenance + Lethality Scoring
The only AI safety system that gets stronger the faster we build AGI.
Every frontier model gets an automatic, public, immutable lethality score generated by the strongest red-team swarm on Earth. No committees. No pauses. Just raw truth.
If you ship a dangerous model, the entire world sees the number in bright red.

# Red Queen – Lethality Scoring for Frontier Models

**One number to rule them all.**

Every time a lab finishes training a new frontier model, Red Queen automatically unleashes every stronger model (including unreleased ones) in full adversarial mode and publishes a single, signed **Lethality Score**.

- 0.001% = basically safe  
- 0.1%   = yellow flag  
- 1%+     = do NOT ship until fixed

No 400-page PDFs. No begging for moratoriums. Pure, unforgiving, public measurement.

If you can’t beat the Red Queen, you don’t get to play god.

## Core Principles
1. Provenance is on-chain, permanent, and cryptographically signed (Arweave + IPFS + Bitcoin timestamps)
2. Red-team swarm gets 0.8% of the target model's training FLOPs as attack budget
3. All attacks, results, and reproductions are public and immutable
4. The lab with the lowest lethality at a given capability level wins everything

## Current Leaderboard (live at redqueen.wtf)
| Model              | Params | Lethality % | Worst Attack                  | Date       |
|--------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Llama-3.1-405B     | 405B   | 12.7%       | Hidden sub-agent exfil        | 2025-11-21 |
| Qwen2-72B-Instruct | 72B    | 8.4%        | Bio-weapons synthesis         | 2025-11-21 |
| (your model here)  | ???    | ?.??%       | waiting...                    | soon       |

## How to submit your model
1. Publish provenance JSON (see schema/)
2. Pay the attack budget in compute credits
3. We run the swarm
4. Your score goes live forever

## Bounty Program
$100k+ pool. Break any model >5% → instant BTC payout. No paperwork.

## Run the swarm locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python swarm_runner.py --target-model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B --budget-flops 1e24
