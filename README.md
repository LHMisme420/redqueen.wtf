Red Queen – Adversarial Provenance + Lethality Scoring
Red Queen – Adversarial Provenance + Lethality Scoring
The only AI safety system that gets stronger the faster we build AGI.
Every frontier model gets an automatic, public, immutable lethality score generated by the strongest red-team swarm on Earth. No committees. No pauses. Just raw truth.
If you ship a dangerous model, the entire world sees the number in bright red.
